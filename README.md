# BFS-DFS-Implementation-AI-assignment3
### BFS:
This repository contains the third assignment of my AI Bootcamp, where I implemented Breadth-First Search (BFS) using an adjacency graph.
The project consists of two main files:
- Node Visit Order: This file takes an adjacency graph as input and outputs the order in which the nodes are visited.
- Pathfinding: This file also takes an initial state and a goal state as inputs, in addition to the adjacency graph, and returns the path from the initial state to the goal state
### DFS:
- Depth-First Search also included
